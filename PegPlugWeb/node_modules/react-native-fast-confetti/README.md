## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This library depends on [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) and [@shopify/react-native-skia](https://github.com/Shopify/react-native-skia). Make sure to install those first.

```sh
yarn add react-native-fast-confetti
```

## Usage
### `<Confetti />`
This animation creates a basic confetti effect where pieces fall from the top in a straight line.

You can also use the `cannonPositions` option to simulate confetti being launched from cannons before falling. in the screen recording, there's only one cannon. You can also pass multiple cannon positions to shoot confetti from multiple cannons

```tsx
import { Confetti } from 'react-native-fast-confetti';

// ...

return (
    <View>
    {...Your other components}
    <Confetti />
    {...Your other components}
    </View>
)
```
### `<PIConfetti />`
This confetti type creates an effect where flakes burst outward from the center, and then drift down gracefully.

```tsx
import { PIConfetti } from 'react-native-fast-confetti';

// ...

return (
    <View>
    {...Your other components}
    <PIConfetti />
    {...Your other components}
    </View>
)
